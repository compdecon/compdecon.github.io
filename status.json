    "Space Weather Message Code: SUM10R\r\nSerial Number: 798\r\nIssue Time: 2024 May 10 0716 UTC\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: 10cm Radio Burst\r\nBegin Time: 2024 May 10 0638 UTC\r\nMaximum Time: 2024 May 10 0643 UTC\r\nEnd Time: 2024 May 10 0654 UTC\r\nDuration: 16 minutes\r\nPeak Flux: 900 sfu\r\nLatest Penticton Noon Flux: 233 sfu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: A 10cm radio burst indicates that the electromagnetic burst associated with a solar flare at the 10cm wavelength was double or greater than the initial 10cm radio background. This can be indicative of significant radio noise in association with a solar flare. This noise is generally short-lived but can cause interference for sensitive receivers including radar, GPS, and satellite communications.",
    "Space Weather Message Code: ALTXMF\r\nSerial Number: 375\r\nIssue Time: 2024 May 10 0644 UTC\r\n\r\nALERT: X-Ray Flux exceeded M5\r\nThreshold Reached: 2024 May 10 0641 UTC\r\nNOAA Scale: R2 - Moderate\r\n\r\nNOAA Space Weather Scale descriptions can be found at\r\nwww.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation\r\n\r\nPotential Impacts: Area of impact centered on sub-solar point on the sunlit side of Earth. Extent of blackout of HF (high frequency) radio communication dependent upon current X-ray Flux intensity.
